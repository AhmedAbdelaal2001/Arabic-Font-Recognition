# Feature Selection and Extraction

This is where feature extraction will take place

## Contents

1. **BoVW.py**:
   - Responsible for extracting Bag of Visual Words features using SIFT descriptors from a given image.

2. **BoVW.ipynb**:
   - This is where the BoVW feature extractor is tested and visualized

3. **FeatureExtraction.py**:
   - This class wraps the BoVW class, and is responsible for extracting features from an image. It can be extended to more features.

4. **FeatureExtraction.ipynb**:
   - This is where the Feature Extraction code as a whole is tested, and the quality of our features is put to the test

Note that there are more files that were not used in our final model in any way. But they were part of the process, so we left it here; they involve extracting Gabor features, as well as features from Low's texture energy measures.
